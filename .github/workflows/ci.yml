  # pull_request_target is needed for PRs created by release-please bot.
  # GitHub Actions prevents workflows from triggering on PRs created with
  # GITHUB_TOKEN to avoid recursive workflow runs. Since release-please
  # uses GITHUB_TOKEN, its PRs won't trigger the `pull_request` event.
  # pull_request_target runs in the base branch context but triggers for
  # bot-created PRs. This is safe for release-please since it only updates
  # version numbers and changelogs.
